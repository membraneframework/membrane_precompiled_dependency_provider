Package providing URLs for precompiled dependencies used by Membrane plugins.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `membrane_precompiled_dependency_provider` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:membrane_precompiled_dependency_provider, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

In most cases the package is intended to provide an URL to be used in your project's `bundlex.exs`. This text will assume familiarity with Bundlex and it's mechanism of managing precompiled dependencies, so if you're not acquainted with it you can read about it [here](https://hexdocs.pm/bundlex/readme.html).

Dependencies that are fully located in a correctly structured repository in `membraneframework-precompiled` github organization (details [here](https://github.com/membraneframework-precompiled)) will be referred to as _Generic_. Otherwise they will be referred to as _Non-generic_.

The simplest example of `natives/0` function in `bundlex.exs`, where we have an `:example` native that has an `:example_dep` Generic dependency:

```elixir
defp natives() do
  [
    example: [
      interface: :nif,
      sources: ["example.c"],
      os_deps: [
        example_dep: 
        [{
          :precompiled, 
          Membrane.PrecompiledDependencyProvider.get_dependency_url(:example_dep)
        }]
      ],
      preprocessor: Unifex
    ]
  ]
```

## Adding new dependencies

Pool of dependencies offered by this package can be expanded with new ones, _Generic_ and _Non-generic_, by modifying `lib/membrane_precompiled_dependency_provider.ex` appropriately.

To add any dependency start by adding it's name as one of possible values of `precompiled_dependencies()` type:
```elixir
@type precompiled_dependency() :: ... | :example_dep
```

When the dependency is _Generic_ (is present on `membraneframework-precompiled`) that is all you need to do.

#### Adding Non-generic dependencies

When the precompiled builds of a dependency are already hosted somewhere else they can be added as a _Non-generic_ dependency. 

To achieve this create a clause of `get_non_generic_dep_url/2` that pattern-matches on your dependency's name and returns an URL appropriate for the passed target:

```elixir
defp get_non_generic_dep_url(:example_non_generic_dep, target) do
  ...
end
```
 
For an example see implementation for `:ffmpeg`.
